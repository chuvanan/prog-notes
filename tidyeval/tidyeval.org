#+TITLE: Tidy Evaluation


* Theory

** Is tidy evaluatino worthy?

The benefits of tidyeval:

- It saves (a lot) of typing which is convenient for interactive work

- It helps build DSL

The downside of tidyeval (and NSE in general):

- Code is ambiguous (not referentially transparent) which makes functions more
  unpredictable

** Jargon

- quasiquotation

- quosures


* Applications


* Cookbook (solutions to common problems)
