This is a short guide for those working (or living) in (Gnome) terminal.

*** Solarized theme

[[https://github.com/altercation/solarized][Solarized]] is a well designed color palette which is used extensively in terminal
and gui applications. For theory behind the colors, and screenshots, see the
[[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized][Solarized homepage]].

Here's a quick installation guide:

- Install ~dconf~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install dconf-cli
#+END_SRC

- Install setting scripts. You'll be asked for selecting ~dark~ or ~light~
  theme, and installing ~dircolors~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
./install.sh
#+END_SRC

- Activate ~dircolors~:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ -f ~/.dir_colors/dircolors ]
    then eval `dircolors ~/.dir_colors/dircolors`
fi
#+END_SRC
