#+TITLE: FUTURE


** About

- A ~future~ is an abstraction for a value that may be available at some point
  in the future.

- The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved.

- If the value is queried while the future is still unresolved, the current
  process is blocked until the future is resolved.

- It is possible to check whether a future is resolved or not without blocking.

#+BEGIN_SRC r
  library(future)
  ## implicit future
  v %<-% {
      cat("Resolving ...\n")
      3.14
  }

  ## explicit future
  f <- future({
      cat("Resolving ...\n")
      3.14
  })
  v <- value(f)
#+END_SRC
